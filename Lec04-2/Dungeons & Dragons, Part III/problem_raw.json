    "description": "<p>In the previous part, we have beat the dragon, and it is time to move on. In this part, we are about to travel through a desert.</p><p>In this part, only three dice, with the highest scores of them are 4 (d1), 6 (d2), and 8 (d3), respectively,  as well as three magic numbers will be used. The three magic numbers are defined as following:</p><pre><code>NUMBER_1 = 0x38E38E38E38E3800LLU\nNUMBER_2 = 0x2AAAAAAAAAAAAAAALLU\nNUMBER_3 = 0x1C71C71C71C71C71LLU</code></pre><p>In your turn, you have to roll three dice and combine the scores of them with three magic numbers:</p><pre><code>(d1 * NUMBER_1 + d2 * NUMBER_2 + d3 * NUMBER_3) mod 0x7CE66C50E2840000LLU</code></pre><p>Then you will get the steps you should take on your next move (Assume that we have such large map).</p>",

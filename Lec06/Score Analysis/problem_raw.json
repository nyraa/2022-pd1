An interval is denoted as <code>[B, A]</code>, TAs want to find out the number of students whose score is <strong>lower than </strong><code>B</code> (<code>score &lt; B</code>) , the number of students whose score is <strong>grater than or equal to </strong><code>B</code><strong> but lower than </strong><code>A</code> (<code>B &lt;= score &lt; A</code>), and the number of students whose score is <strong>grater than or eqaul to </strong><code>A</code> (<code>score &gt;= A</code>).</p><p>Now, given the scores of each student, and different <code>[B, A]</code> intervals, please help TAs do the statistics.</p>",
    "inputFormat": "The first line is an integer N (N < 1024), indicating the number of students.\r\nThe following N lines indicates the score of each student.\r\nThe next line is an integer T, indicating the number of different [B, A] intervals.\r\nAnd the following T lines contain 2 integers, which indicates the value of B and A (B â‰¤ A).",
    "outputFormat": "For each [B, A] interval, print out 3 interger, which represents the number of students whose score is lower than B (score < B) , the number of students whose score is grater than or equal to B but lower than A (B <= score < A), and the number of students whose score is grater than or eqaul to A (score >= A), respectively.",

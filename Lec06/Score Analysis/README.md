### Description
After the midterm exam, TAs want to analyze the number of students lying in different intervals. An interval is denoted as `[B, A]`, TAs want to find out the number of students whose score is **lower than** `B` (`score < B`) , the number of students whose score is **grater than or equal to** `B` **but lower than** `A` (`B <= score < A`), and the number of students whose score is **grater than or eqaul to** `A` (`score >= A`).

Now, given the scores of each student, and different `[B, A]` intervals, please help TAs do the statistics.


### Input
The first line is an integer N (N < 1024), indicating the number of students.
The following N lines indicates the score of each student.
The next line is an integer T, indicating the number of different [B, A] intervals.
And the following T lines contain 2 integers, which indicates the value of B and A (B â‰¤ A).
### Output
For each [B, A] interval, print out 3 interger, which represents the number of students whose score is lower than B (score < B) , the number of students whose score is grater than or equal to B but lower than A (B <= score < A), and the number of students whose score is grater than or eqaul to A (score >= A), respectively.

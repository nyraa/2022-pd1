### Description
It is time for the PD1 rock-paper-scissors Tournament!

In this game, each player will be assigned an id **starting from 1**.  
At the begining, players should select one shape from the rock, paper, and scissors, which are used to compete with other players **in the rest of tournament**. Rock wins against scissors; paper wins against rock; and scissors wins against paper.  
The tournament is single-elimination, in which the player who wins the current round goes through next round.  
The players may pick the same shape in a competition, in which case the winner is decided by their id. **In each round**, the tournament host will provide an instruction, one of `b` and `s`, which indicates the player with the **bigger id** or the **smaller id** wins respectively.

**player input**  
`r` : rock  
`p` : paper  
`s` : scissors

**judge input**  
`s` : smaller  
`b` : bigger

player: `r` `r` `s` `r`

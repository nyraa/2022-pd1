### Description
Welcome to PD1 Coffee Shop! We provide 4 types of coffee:

1. AMERICANO $ 110
2. LATTE $ 150
3. CAPPUCCINO $135
4. MOCHA $ 145

  
Please write a program to calculate **how much should the client pay**.

Be aware of those troublesome customersÔºÅ

Some of them would ask for the coffee that is **not presented in the menu**.


### Input
Two integers i, j separated by a space.
Integer i indicates the type of the coffee on the menu (e.g. 1 is AMERICANO, 2 is LATTE, and so on), with range 1-100.
Integer j indicates how many cups of coffee that the client wants, with range 1-20.
### Output
If the number of coffee is on the menu, you need to print the total price in the following format: "The total price is <price> dollars!", where <price> is the amount of money that the client should pay.
If not, you need to print "Wait, what?".

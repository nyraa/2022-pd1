### Description
There are four people `A` ,`B` ,`C` ,`D` . Each of them has one poker hand which consists of five cards. Each card in the hand will have both a suit (`clubs`, `diamonds`, `hearts`, or `spades`) and a rank (`2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, `10`, `jack`, `queen`, `king`, or `ace`). Write a program that prints out their order **from highest to lowest**.

The categories of hand, from highest to lowest, are listed below:

1. straight flush (both a straight and a flush)
2. four-of-a-kind (four cards of the same rank)
3. full house (a three-of-a-kind and a pair)
4. flush (five cards of the same suit)
5. straight (five cards with consecutive ranks)
6. three-of-a-kind (three cards of the same rank)
7. two pairs
8. pair (two cards of the same rank)
9. high card (any other hand)

We abbreviate ranks and suits as follows (letters may only be lower-case):

Ranks: `2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 t j q k a`

Suits: `c d h s`

Cards are always **compared by rank first**, and only then by suit. We compare suits using the **'reverse alphabetical order'** ranking: spades (highest), hearts, diamonds, clubs (lowest).

If any number of poker hands are **in the same category**, follow the rules below (simplified, not the standard way):

1. straight flush: The one with the higher ranking top card is better. If they are the same, compare the suit of the top cards. (for straight: `2 3 4 5 6` ~ `t j q k a`)
2. four-of-a-kind: The one with the higher ranking set of four cards is better.
3. full house: The one with the higher ranking set of three cards is better.
4. flush: Same as 1.
5. straight: Same as 1.
6. three-of-a-kind: Same as 3.
7. two pairs: The hand with the highest ranking pair wins. If they have the same rank, compare the highest suit of the highest ranking pair.
8. pair: Same as 7.
9. high card: Same as 1.

Note: not allow the use of jokers, and assume that aces are high.
